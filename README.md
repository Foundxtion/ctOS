# ctOS: The Central Operating system

This repository contains an opinionated configuration for nix-based systems.
It includes NixOS configurations along with Home-manager configuration.

ctOS is built for one-user systems only.

With ctOS, with the same configuration, you can easily deploy:
- Servers for hosting preconfigured services, or your custom services using
  NixOS infrastructure as code system.
- Dev workstations that are strongly configured to provide software engineers a
  streamlined work environment.
